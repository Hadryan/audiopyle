## Feature visualization

To be able to see plugin output visually, a tool called [Sonic Visualizer](https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/) is needed

Also, you should download set of [VAMP Plugins](https://www.vamp-plugins.org/download.html) to be able to make analysis. You can download large set of VAMP plugins for Linux platform as single zip from [my GDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S60frCyf8o8v29lJeCpwnLcIFWI6N2ze).

Plugins need to be placed under:
 - in case of Linux: `$HOME/vamp` or `/usr/local/lib/vamp` 
 - in case of OS/X: `$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Vamp` or `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Vamp` 
 - in case of Windows (64-bit): `C:\Program Files (x86)\Vamp Plugins`
